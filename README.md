# LRU-Cache
LRU Cache implementation in C++
# LRU Cache Implementation (C++)

## Description
Implemented an LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache using a combination of
unordered_map and doubly linked list to achieve O(1) time complexity
for get and put operations.

## Features
- Constant-time cache access and updates
- Automatic eviction of least recently used elements
- Clean and modular design

## Technologies
- C++
- STL (unordered_map)

## Time Complexity
- get(): O(1)
- put(): O(1)
